<p>One Hundered Years of Solitude - Gabriel Garcia Marquez</p>
<ul>
    <li>“A trickle of blood came out under the door, crossed the living room, went out into the street, continued on in a straight line across the uneven terraces, went down the steps and climbed over curbs, passed along the Street of Turks, turned a corner to the right and another to the left, made a right angle at the Buendia house, went in under the closed door, crossed through the parlor, hugging the walls so as not to stain the rugs, went on to the other living room, made wide curve avoid the dining-room table, went along <b style="color:#900C3F">the porch with the begonias</b>, and passed without being seen under Amaranta’s chair as she gave an arithmetic lesson to Aureliano Jose, and went through the pantry and came out in the kitchen, where Ursula was getting ready to crack thirty-six eggs to make bread.” p135</li>
    <li>"Then they went into Jose Arcadio Buendia’s room, shook him as hard as they could, shouted in his ear, put a mirror in front of his nostrils, but they could not awaken him. A short time later, when the carpenter was taking measurements for the coffin, through the window <b style="color:#900C3F">they saw a light rain of tiny yellow flowers falling</b>. They fell on the town all through the night in a silent storm, and they covered the roofs and blocked the doors and smothered the animals who slept outdoors. So many flowers fell from the sky that in the morning the streets were carpeted with a compact cushion and they had to clear them away with shovels and rakes so that the funeral procession could pass by.” p144</li>
    <li>“”How strange men are,” she said, because she could not think of anything else to say. “They spend their lives fighting against priests and then give prayerbooks as gifts.” p166</li>
    <li>“With that discouraging explanation many felt that they had been the victims of some new and showy gypsy business and they decided not to return to the movies, considering that they already had too many troubles of their own to weep over the acted-out misfortunes of imaginary beings” p230</li>
    <li>“Every time she appeared in the dining room, against Ursula’s orders, she caused a panic of exasperation among the outsiders. It was all too evident that she was completely naked underneath her crude night-shirt and no one could understand that her shaved and perfect skull was not some kind of challenge, and that <b style="color:#900C3F">the boldness with which she uncovered her thighs to cool off was not a criminal provocation</b>, nor was her pleasure when she sucked her fingers after eating.” p237 Remedios the Beauty…”In reality, it made no difference to her where she ate, and not at regular hours but according to the whims of her appetite. Sometimes she would get up to have lunch at three in the morning, sleep all day long, and she spent several months with her timetable in disarray until some casual incident would bring her back into the order of things.”</li>
    <li>“We fought all those wars and all of it just so that we didn’t have to paint our houses blue.” p244</li>
    <li>“She began to make mistakes, trying to see with her eyes the things that <b style="color:#900C3F">intuition allowed her to see with greater clarity</b>” p256</li>
    <li>“Fernandez was scandalised that she did not understand the relationship of Catholicism with life but only it’s relationship with death, as if it were not a religion but a compendium of funeral conventions.” P282</li>
    <li>“Aureliano Segundo returned home with his trunks, convinced that not only Ursula but all the inhabitants of Macondo were waiting for it to clear in order to die. He had seen them as he passed by, sitting in their parlours with an absorbed look and folded arms, <b style="color:#900C3F">feeling unbroken time pass</b>, relentless time, because it was useless to divide it into months and years, and the days into hours, when one could do nothing but contemplate the rain.” P327</li>
    <li>“On the other hand, she confirmed the existence of the treasure with the precision of its consisting of <b style="color:#900C3F">seven thousand two hundred fourteen</b> coins buried in three canvas sacks reinforced with copper wire within a circle with a radius of three hundred eighty-eight feet with Ursula’s bed as the centre, but she warned that it would not be found int it stopped raining and the suns of three consecutive Junes had changed the piles of mud into dust.” P335</li>
    <li>“Then Ursula gave in to the evidence. “My God,” she exclaimed in a low voice. “So this is what it’s like to be dead.” P348</li>
    <li>“Gaston was not only a fierce lover, with endless wisdom and imagination, but he was also, perhaps, the first man in the history of the species who had made an emergency landing and had come close to killing himself and his sweetheart simply <b style="color:#900C3F">to make love in a field of violets</b>.”</li>
    <li>“It never occurred to him until then to think that literature was the best plaything that had ever been invented to make fun of people, as Alvaro demonstrated during one night of revels. Some time would have to pass before Aureliano realised that such arbitrary attitudes hd their origins in the example of the wise Catalonian, for whom wisdom was worth nothing if it could not be used to invent a new way of preparing chick peas.” p394
        </li>
    <li>“Trying to overcome his disturbance, he grasped at the voice that he was losing, the life that was leaving him, the memory that was turning into a petrified polyp, and he spoke to her about the priestly destiny of Sanskrit, the scientific possibility of seeing the future showing through in time as one sees what is written on the back of a sheet of paper through the light, the necessity of deciphering the predictions so that they would not defeat themselves, and the Centuries of Nostradamus and the destruction of Cantabria predicted by Saint Milanus.” p397
    </li>
    <li>“Frightened by the passion of the outburst, Amaranta Ursula was closing her fingers, contracting them like a shellfish until her wounded hand, free of all pain and any vestige of pity, was converted into a knot of emeralds and topazes and stony and unfeeling bones.” p400</li>
    <li>“”The world must be all fucked up,” he said then, “when <b style="color:#900C3F">men travel first class and literature goes as freight.</b>””p406</li>
    <li>“At first he told them that everything was just the same, that the pink snails were still in the house where he had been born, that the dry herring still had the same taste on a piece of toast, that the waterfalls in the village still took on a perfumed smell at dusk.” p407</li>
    <li>“The ancient priest who had taken Father Angel’s place and whose name no one had bothered to find out awaited God’s mercy stretched out casually in a hammock, tortured by arthritis and the insomnia of doubt while the lizards and rats are fought over the inheritance of the nearby church.” p409</li>
    <li>"He really had been through death, but he had returned because <b style="color:#900C3F">he could not bear the solitude</b>." p50</li>
